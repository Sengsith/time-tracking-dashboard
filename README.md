## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

The number one thing I want to continue to learn is grid. My solution definitely could have been cleaner and still isn't perfect right now just by looking at the activity cards. I also want to optimize my javascript because there is a lot of repeated code that can be refactored/optimized.
